# vims_detection_1d-cnn_classifier
Conv1D,  VIMS detection,  binary/multiple classifier

Hyperparameter selection: first use grid search to find a better set of hyperparameters, and then manually fine-tune to find the parameters suitable for the model.

The best model for 1d-cnn has been saved in the directory: vims_detection_1d-cnn_classifier/code/ten best model for paper/...
These best models can be loaded to reproduce the results in the paper.
